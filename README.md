# Simple TicTacToe game with GUI

## A 2-player TicTacToe game where you play your turn by clicking squares, not typing.

TicTacToe, traditionally known as Noughts and Crosses. Well, I'm sure this game is pretty well-known so, let's talk about the project. For programmer hatchlings who are learning to code, this game is good practice. And it is for me as well! because I'm a hatchling myself :hatching_chick:

This Tictactoe game has a GUI that I made using Tkinter, instead of typing the option to play your turn you just have to click the tile to play your turn. The tiles are made up of buttons placed inside a 3x3 grid made of row and column configure in a frame. 

Ps - The logic I used to check the win conditions, I think it's a bit.. weird.. or hilarious, one might say. So, go check it out yourself if you'd like.
